# rhythm-tutor

This project uses Node.js and a package manager. I used npm, so all the commands below are listed as npm. However, the commands should be the same for other package managers (I think) such as pnpm or bun.

Installation for Node.js and npm can be found at `https://nodejs.org/en/download`.

```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

### Compiles and minifies for production

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
